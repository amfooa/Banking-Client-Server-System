First,
You need to use QT Creator to build and run two Deamons that is in Directory (bankingSystem) for client and in Directory (bankingSystemServer) for server and check (bankingSystem/admin.cpp) line #10 for IP to make communication between client and server
Use command line interface to login as admin or as client then continue using the privilage of each of them.
